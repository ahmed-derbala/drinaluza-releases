## [1.65.0] - 21 september 2026

### Enhanced
- Improved the product feed card layout with better spacing and visual hierarchy.
- Updated Expo SDK packages (expo, expo-router, expo-updates, expo-notifications, expo-location, expo-sharing, expo-build-properties) for stability and compatibility.
- Improved Android release build reliability by enabling the new architecture with SDK auto-download and limiting parallel build jobs to prevent out-of-memory errors.

### Fixed
- Fixed the product feed card layout on mobile devices by adjusting padding and margin values to ensure consistent spacing across all screen sizes.
- Fixed the in-app update check URL to use the renamed drinaluza-releases repository.
- Fixed the changelog publishing step and wired it into the production APK build.
- Fixed the development APK build environment flag (local to development).
